Dice Game. The objective is to accumulate 20 points
by rolling the die, but beware â€“ rolling a 0 results in a
missed turn. Players can decide whether to hold their
current score or pass the die to the other player for a
roll. The first to reach 20 points wins, and a lively
animation showcases the results.
